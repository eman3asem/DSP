# DSP
this project contains 2 different approaches done in an application of digital signal processing 

## DFT
in this projetc I am 
- Generating samples and plot the following sequence:
  x[n] = (sin(2 π n / 40) + 2 sin(2 π n / 16)) exp(-((n-128) / 64)2)
- Taking the 256 point DFT of this signal. Plot the real and imaginary parts.
- Converting the frequency spectrum into polar form. Plot the magnitude and phase parts.
- Applying the Inverse DFT of 256 DFT spectrum. Compare the resulting time domain signal with
the original
- designing a python code to apply the DFT and inverse DFT on an audio after selecting a suitable sampling rate.

## Sterio to Mono
###in this project I designed python programs:
- Convert the sterio Audio to mono using signal manipulation
- strech or a shrink an audio according to a chosen factor
